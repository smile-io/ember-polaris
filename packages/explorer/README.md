# Explorer

This is an application dedicated to running [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to explore Polaris.

**NOTE:** There's no easy way currently to have hot-reload working when changing `ember-polaris` component implementations _(you need to restart Storybook)_, however, story updates should work.

```bash
# At the root of the monorepo
pnpm storybook
```
